# A Contrasting World

Around the same time, I had an opportunity to use **TRON/μT-Kernel** in an embedded system.

I was amazed.

**Code from 20 years ago runs almost unchanged.**

Old documentation still works. No need to relearn. **A consistent design philosophy** runs through it.

**Why is it so different?**

## 40 Years of Stability

**The TRON Project** (1984~):

Since its inception in 1984, the TRON Project has **maintained the stability of its basic interface through a consistent design philosophy**.

The main reason embedded device manufacturers continue to adopt it is the reliability that **"the same assets (code) and know-how can be utilized even 20 years later"** because specifications don't change due to platform convenience.

This consistency is the greatest value. Knowledge gained through updates doesn't become obsolete, and education is easy. This is at the heart of why TRON continues to be supported by industry.

Reason: **The philosophy that "social infrastructure should not be broken"**

TRON is not just a technical standard. It was designed with **the philosophy that social infrastructure should not be broken**.

**Linux Kernel** (2004~):
- User space API unchanged for 20 years
- Linus Torvalds' iron rule: **"No breaking userspace"**  
  (Don't break user space)

**"If it breaks things, we don't need new features"**

This is Linus's principle. As a responsibility to developers.

**FreeBSD**:
- Similar emphasis on stability
- Obsession with backward compatibility

## In Contrast, Modern Platforms

**App Store Connect**: Changes every few weeks to months  
**Expo EAS**: Changes every few months  
**RevenueCat**: Monthly changes

## The Question

**Why are technologies from 40 years ago more stable?**

Newer technologies are more chaotic.

Is this a technical problem?  
Or is it something else?

**The answer lies in the flow of money.**
