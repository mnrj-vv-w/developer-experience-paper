# Finally

What will change by writing this article?

Immediately, nothing may change.

**But change always starts quietly.**

One PM might hesitate to change the UI.  
One VC might consider a long-term fund.  
100 developers might start speaking up.

That's enough.

## I've Already Started Taking Action

**`developer-experience-observatory`**

Launched on GitHub.

**Goals**:
- **6 months**: Community of 1,000
- **18 months**: Standards development
- **3 years**: Certification system establishment

This is the first step toward Developer Experience Council.

5 years from now, when I read this article again, I want to be able to say, "That was the beginning."

## Jobs's Words

Steve Jobs said at WWDC in 1997:

*"You've got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology."*

He was right.

But Apple in 2025 seems to have forgotten that.

So let's remind them.

Another Jobs quote:

*"The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do."*

Right now, I'm a little crazy.

**Will you get crazy with me?**

**Those "slightly crazy people" quietly move the world.**

Prof. Ken Sakamura, 
leader of the TRON Project.

His detailed comments on the technical descriptions of TRON
were extremely helpful in revisiting and refining the explanations
presented in this article.

I am deeply grateful.
