# A Call to Developers

To developers,

Have you experienced the same thing?

**You're not alone.**

**You just want to do your work, too.**

Do you think this is "normal"?

**Let's speak up.**

---

## Concrete Actions

**① Send Apple Feedback**
- Specifically: "I lost X hours due to this change"
- With data: "Number of support inquiries"
- Constructively: "This is how it could be improved"

**② Record time costs**
- Time spent responding to platform changes
- Time spent relearning
- This visualizes "hidden costs"

**③ Speak up on social media**
- Not emotionally, but constructively
- With data
- With #DeveloperExperience tag

---

## Shall We Collect Data Together?

I'm starting to record on GitHub:

**`developer-experience-observatory`**

**This is "a place to turn anger into data".**

Here:
- Record platform changes
- Measure developer satisfaction
- Share best practices
