# Not Just Me

When I looked into it, I saw the same pattern.

**Apple App Store Connect**: UI changes almost monthly. Button positions, workflow redesigns.

**Expo EAS**: Command options change every few months. Was it `--clear-cache` or `--no-cache`? Even the documentation has different descriptions depending on the version.

**RevenueCat**: The settings screen that existed last week has changed this week, along with the entire menu structure.

**Three things in common**:

1. **No advance notice** of changes
2. **Documentation doesn't keep up**
3. **Even AI can't catch up with yesterday's UI changes**

Result: **The only option is to contact support every time**.

This phenomenon isn't limited to specific apps. **It's happening structurally to all developers.**

## Hidden Costs

This instability isn't just about irritation.  
**When you quantify it, it's much more serious.**

**Assumptions**:
- Total mobile/web developers worldwide: **27 million**  
  (Source: Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023)
- Those affected by platform changes: **10%** = 2.7 million
- Time spent responding to platform changes: **1 hour/month**

**Calculation**:
```
2.7 million × 1 hour/month × 12 months
= 32.4 million hours/year

At $50/hour (¥7,000):
= $1.62B (approximately ¥220 billion) /year
```

Note that this is a **conservative estimate**.  
In reality, most people spend more than 1 hour per month.

**This is an "unmeasured hidden cost".**

It doesn't appear in VC KPIs:
- ❌ MAU (Monthly Active Users)
- ❌ Revenue growth rate  
- ❌ Engagement

**What isn't measured doesn't exist.**  
**So no one measures it, and no one improves it.**

## The Question

Is this "progress"? Or is it "chaos"?

Are these monthly UI changes really for users?  
Or are they for someone else?

To find the answer, let's look at a contrasting world.
