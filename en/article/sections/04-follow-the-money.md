# Follow the Money

When I looked into it, the funding structures were completely different.

## The Reality of VC Money

**Expo** (EAS development):
- Raised **$27M** from Amplify Partners (2019)
- Condition: **5-7 year Exit** (IPO or acquisition)

**RevenueCat**:
- Raised **$56.5M** total from Index Ventures
- Same: **5-7 year Exit**

**Apple**:
- **65%** held by institutional investors
- Major shareholders: Vanguard, BlackRock, Berkshire Hathaway
- What they look at: **Quarterly earnings numbers**

## Structural Constraints of VC Funds

**Why 5-7 years?**

VC funds are legally **liquidated in 10 years** (Limited Partnership agreement).
```
Year 0: Fund formation (fundraising from LPs)
Year 1-3: Investment period
Year 4-7: Growth period
Year 7-10: Exit & repayment period
  ↓
Year 10: Forced termination
```

In other words, **you must Exit by Year 7 to make it in time**.

## Quarterly KPI Pressure

Metrics VCs demand from portfolio companies:

**Measured**:
- ✅ MAU growth rate: Minimum **30-50%/quarter**
- ✅ Revenue growth rate: Minimum **50-100%/quarter**
- ✅ Next fundraising preparation (every 18-24 months)

**Not measured**:
- ❌ Developer learning costs
- ❌ Documentation quality
- ❌ Number of support inquiries
- ❌ Community burnout

## The Reality of Board Meetings
```
VC: "What's this quarter's growth rate?"
CEO: "Up 30% from last quarter"
VC: "Not enough. Without 50%, valuation will drop in the next round"
CEO: "Understood... I'll add some new features..."
  ↓
Result: Changes for the sake of changes
```

## In Contrast, TRON/Linux

**TRON**:
- Funding source: Membership fees, corporate consortium
- Exit deadline: **None**
- Evaluation cycle: Yearly (relaxed)
- Time horizon: **10-30 years**

**Linux**:
- Funding source: Linux Foundation (corporate membership fees)
- Exit deadline: **None**
- Evaluation metrics: Stability, compatibility
- Time horizon: **Long-term**

## Conclusion

**There are no "bad people" here.**

**What's bad is the "algorithm" that optimizes everything for short-term profits.**

- VCs must repay in 10 years
- So they demand 5-7 year Exits from portfolio companies
- So portfolio companies must continuously show "growth"
- So they frantically make changes
- So developers get whipsawed

Everyone is acting rationally.  
But the system as a whole is broken.

**What we lose every day isn't numbers, but "quiet time".**

Time to learn. Time to create. Time to think.

That's being silently stolen away in the shadow of KPIs.
