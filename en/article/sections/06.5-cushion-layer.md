# A Viable Solution: Designing the "Cushion Layer"

So what should we do?

**What this article ultimately proposes is  
a structural solution through a "cushion layer".**

**This is not a demand.  
It's a framework for cooperation.**

---

## The Idea of Clean Architecture

This is an attempt to apply the idea of **"Clean Architecture"** from software design to social systems.

Developers should intuitively understand this.

## Current State: Tightly Coupled System

**To put the essence of the problem in one sentence,  
it's a structure where "short-term pressure directly hits frontline developers".**
```
    LP (Pension Funds)
        ↓
   "Quarterly returns!"
        ↓
       VC
        ↓
   "Increase growth rate!"
        ↓
   Startup
        ↓
    "UI change frenzy"
        ↓
      Developer
        ↓
    "Whipsawed..."
```

**Problem**: VC's short-term pressure reaches developers directly. Developers' voices don't reach VCs.

## Proposal: Loosely Coupled System
```
    LP (Pension Funds)
        ↓
   "Quarterly returns!"
        ↓
       VC
        ↓
  ┌─────────────────┐
  │ Developer Experience │
  │      Council         │← Developer voices
  │   (Cushion Layer)    │
  └─────────────────┘
        ↓
   "Please follow standards"
        ↓
   Startup
        ↓
   "Get DX Certified"
        ↓
      Developer
        ↓
    "Not whipsawed!"
```

**The cushion layer produces three things:**

1. **Pressure absorption** (Shield direct damage from VC→Developer)
2. **Information translation** (Quantitative feedback from Developer→VC)
3. **Action synchronization** (Market pressure makes it easier for both companies and developers to move)

## Concrete Proposal: Developer Experience Council + Certification System

**Organization**:
- Independent non-profit organization
- 3 VC representatives + 3 developer representatives + 3 neutral experts

**Roles**:
1. Review platform changes
2. Measure developer satisfaction
3. Award **"DX Certified" certification**

---

## Certification Standards (3 Levels)

**Level 1 (Basic)**:
- ✓ Documentation updated simultaneously
- ✓ 1 week advance notice of changes
- ✓ Support system

**Level 2 (Standard)**:
- ✓ Level 1 + 
- ✓ Beta period (1 month)
- ✓ Migration guide provided
- ✓ Developer NPS 60+

**Level 3 (Excellent)**:
- ✓ Level 2 +
- ✓ Advance voting on breaking changes
- ✓ Old version coexists for 6 months
- ✓ Developer NPS 80+

---

## Market Mechanism

**Display "DX Certified Level 3" badge on company site**
  ↓
Developers choose certified companies (**market pressure**)
  ↓
VCs prioritize certified companies (**reputational risk avoidance**)

**Result**: No one "forces" it, but everyone "must comply"

---

## Existing Success Models

This isn't fantasy. It's proven in other industries:

**PCI DSS** (Payment industry):
- Self-regulatory standard
- Can't process payments without compliance
- Dramatically improved security

**ISO 9001** (Quality management):
- International certification system
- Certified companies gain brand value
- Improved quality across the industry

**B Corporation** (Social enterprises):
- Third-party certification
- Obtained by Patagonia, Ben & Jerry's, etc.
- Proof of stakeholder focus

**The developer tools industry can do it too.**

## First Step: You Can Start Today

**Phase 1 (0-6 months)**: Data collection
- Launch `developer-experience-observatory`
- Record platform changes
- Measure developer satisfaction
- Build community of 1,000

**Phase 2 (6-18 months)**: Standards development
- Form Working Group
- Draft "Developer Experience Standards v1.0"
- Collect public comments

**Phase 3 (18-36 months)**: Launch certification system
- Establish non-profit organization
- Initial 10-20 certified companies
- Media exposure, create brand value

**Phase 4 (3-5 years)**: Industry standardization
- Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc. participate
- Become de facto standard

It might take 5 years.

But **it's feasible**.

And **the first step can be taken today**.
