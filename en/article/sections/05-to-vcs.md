# A Question to VCs

To VCs,

**We share the same goal.**

The goal of "creating better services and generating sustainable value."

With that said, I want to pose one question:

---

I have no intention of denying your investment strategy.

Aiming for Exit in 5-7 years is rational given the structure of funds. And this strategy has greatly contributed to accelerating innovation.

But I want to ask:

**"Does the same model fit all sectors?"**

---

## Differences by Sector

For consumer apps (SNS, etc.), short-term Exits may be fine. Trends change quickly.

But **developer tools are different**.

These are infrastructure. They're used for 10, 20 years.

Developers want tools they can use for 10 years.  
You want Exit in 5 years.

**Are you aware of this fundamental mismatch?**

---

## Long-term Risks

Long-term costs created by short-term change frenzy:

- Developer attrition and burnout
- Loss of community trust
- Accumulation of technical debt

These appear as **"valuation losses"** in the next fundraising round.

Furthermore: A reputation as an "unstable tool" **lowers valuation at Exit**.

In other words, short-term growth appeals may be undermining long-term value.

---

## Proposal

**How about experimenting with 15-20 year long-term funds?**

You might think "low returns."

But look at the history of infrastructure investment:
- Power grids
- Telecommunications networks
- Roads

These were "low return, long-term, stable," but ultimately **generated the most reliable returns**.

Developer tools are the same infrastructure.

---

**Do short-term capital really fit developer tools?**
