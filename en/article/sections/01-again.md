# Again

App Store Connect has changed again.

The UI I just learned last month has moved to a different location. Button placements have changed, workflows have changed, and the documentation hasn't caught up.

I ask ChatGPT, but it only returns outdated information. Same with Bing AI. Google Search too. **There is no single source of information that has caught up with the latest UI changes.**

In the end, I have to contact support again.

This gets resolved in a day or two. But **it keeps repeating**.

Expo's EAS. The command options that worked a few months ago have changed again. Was it `--clear-cache` or `--no-cache`? Even looking at the documentation, the descriptions differ by version. Stack Overflow answers from six months ago no longer work.

RevenueCat's dashboard. The settings screen that was there last week has changed entirely, along with the menu structure.

Every time, relearning.  
Every time, reset.

**What a waste of time.**

I want to solve fundamental problems. I want to implement new features. I want to deliver value to users.

But in reality, **I'm forced to spend time "relearning" every single time**.

Is this really progress?  
Or is it just chaos?

And I suddenly thought:

"Is this just my problem?"
