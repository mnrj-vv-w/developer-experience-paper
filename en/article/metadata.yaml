abstract: |
  This paper analyzes the structural instability in modern developer tools 
  (App Store Connect, Expo EAS, RevenueCat) caused by VC funding models, 
  contrasting it with TRON/Linux's 40-year stability. It proposes a 
  "cushion layer" solution—Developer Experience Council + DX Certified 
  certification—based on clean architecture principles applied to social systems.

acknowledgments: |
  Special thanks to Prof. Ken Sakamura (TRON Project Leader, Toyo University) 
  for his valuable feedback on the technical descriptions of TRON, which 
  greatly improved the accuracy of this paper.

notes: |
  This paper originated from personal frustration with frequent platform 
  changes and evolved into a structural analysis of VC-driven instability. 
  The "cushion layer" concept applies clean architecture principles from 
  software engineering to social system design.
