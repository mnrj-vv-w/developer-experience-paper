abstract: |
  This paper analyzes the structural instability in modern developer tools 
  (App Store Connect, Expo EAS, RevenueCat) caused by VC funding models, 
  contrasting it with TRON/Linux's 40-year stability. It proposes a 
  "cushion layer" solution—Developer Experience Council + DX Certified 
  certification—based on clean architecture principles applied to social systems.

acknowledgments: |
  In writing this paper, I received valuable feedback from Prof. Ken Sakamura,
  leader of the TRON Project. His detailed comments on the technical descriptions of TRON
  were extremely helpful in revisiting and refining the explanations presented in this article.
  I am deeply grateful.


notes: |
  This paper originated from personal frustration with frequent platform 
  changes and evolved into a structural analysis of VC-driven instability. 
  The "cushion layer" concept applies clean architecture principles from 
  software engineering to social system design.
