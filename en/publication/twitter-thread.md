App Store Connect changed again.
The UI I just learned last month moved to a different location...

When I looked into it, I saw the same pattern:

- App Store Connect: monthly changes
- Expo EAS: changes every few months
- RevenueCat: weekly changes

Common: No notice, docs don't catch up, AI doesn't help

I did the math.

27M developers worldwide
Affected: 2.7M (10%)
Time spent: 1hr/month

= $1.62B ($220B) annual loss

This is an "unmeasured hidden cost"

Why so unstable?

Let's look at a contrasting world:

TRON (1984~): 40 years stable
Linux: 20 years stable

"No breaking userspace" - Linus

Why are 40-year-old technologies more stable?

Right now, I'm a little crazy.

Will you get crazy with me?
